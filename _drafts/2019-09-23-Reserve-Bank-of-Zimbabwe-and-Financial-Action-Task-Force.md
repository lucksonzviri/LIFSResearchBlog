##Introduction

Modern states have developed mechanisms for requesting and obtaining evidence for criminal investigations and prosecutions. When evidence or other forms of legal assistance, such as witness statements, location of suspect, the service of documents, are needed from a foreign sovereign, states may attempt to cooperate formally through their respective agencies.

This presentation is aimed at giving short and detailed outlook on the relationship Financial Action Task-force has with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe as per international set standards in terms of mutual legal assistance.

##Defining of Terms 

Financial Action Task-Force is a policy-making body which works to generate the necessary political will to bring about national legislative and regulatory reforms in international financial best practises.

State means any member country that has agreed to ratify certain protocol.

Requesting state is any country seeking assistance

Offence any fact or facts which constitute a crime under the laws of a country

Confiscation is any deprivation of ownership of property, goods or money by a competent court in terms of order and includes forfeiture where applicable

Proceeds of crime is any property or assets found directly or indirectly to have been derived from commission of a crime or even other benefits thereof.

Mutual Legal Assistance is any agreement between two or more countries for the purpose of cooperating in gathering and sharing of information in an effort to enforce public or criminal law.

Predicate crimes means a crime that is a component of a more serious crime like money laundering or terrorism financing.

##Relationship Overview

According to Mutual Evaluation report 2016, Zimbabwe was deemed Compliant for 11 and Largely Compliant for 9 of the FATF 40 Recommendations. The implementation of anti-money laundering and counterterrorist financing standards in Zimbabwe was last undertaken by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 2016.
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 by the Ministers of its Member jurisdictions. The objectives of the FATF are to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system.
In Zimbabwe, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) supervises and monitors all financial institutions through the Financial Intelligence Unit and carries out examinations of financial institutions placing emphasis on increased Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, the need to establish the origin of the source of funds as well as identification and reporting of suspicious transactions.

##Why Mutual Legal Assistance is Necessary

According to Financial Intelligence (National Risk Assessment Report 2015), proceeds of crime from Zimbabwe were found to be destined mostly to the following jurisdictions, in order of value, starting with the highest (i) South Africa (minerals and tobacco, and scrap metals, mainly copper), (ii) China, (cash being externalized by businesses); (iii) Botswana, (minerals, fuel and fraud); (iv) Mauritius, (proceeds of externalization), (v) UK/BVI (Proceeds of externalization and proceeds from smuggling of gold) (vi) United Arab Emirates (Dubai) (proceeds from music and video piracy as well as gold and other precious minerals).
It is therefore important to note that, in collaboration with other international stakeholders, the FATF works to identify national-level vulnerabilities with the aim of protecting the international financial system from misuse thus also compliments the need to have mutual legal assistance in place to facilitate an efficient cooperating platform

##Procedure to Obtain Legal Mutual Assistance

There is an legal instrument called Criminal Matters (Mutual Legal Assistance) Act) which gives effect to authorise the process of MLA giving the initial response of sending an acknowledgement of receipt which is followed by a preliminary review of the request to determine any information gaps or availability of information, after which the requesting authority is advised on the possible time for providing the requested information. A maximum of two weeks applies in most cases except where the matter is considered ‘complex’.
The Financial Intelligence Unit through the Office of Director can exchange domestically available information with foreign counterparts on the basis of a bilateral or a multilateral framework for intelligence or investigative purposes in respect to Money laundering or Terrorism Financing and predicate crimes including identification and tracking of assets and instrumentalities of crime.

##Recommendations

Increased measures to identify and assess the risks that come with new technologies and apply the necessary mitigating controls which is very important in this day of Internet of Things(IoT).
A timely evaluation of systems and procedures especially on cybercrime with an emphasis to strengthen financial institution’s approach to financial crime.
FATF should adopt guidelines that will help policy makers and practitioners in national authorities to identify, design and implement risk-based measures to prevent the misuse of corporate vehicles for the purpose of money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit purposes.
The Reserve Bank should put up specific risk management control measures for politically exposed persons, people representing international organisations, close family members and associates thereof.

##Conclusion
This discussion has shown that it is imperative for global approach in having a coordinated effort towards building strong mutual legal relations so as to be able to counter criminal behaviour export or import in a member state, which would go a long way in the prevention and better management of crime.
