## Introduction

While data creation and accessibility has grown dramatically, our ability to consume and utilize that data has not kept up. Data is crossing boundaries more than before. The see something and say something approach has been the underlying operational kind of engagement in running data sources within the Intelligence Community in an effort to gather as much data as possible for analysis in a collaborative effort to satisfy customers who are the decision makers. A technological development that can’t be ignored anymore which is Artificial Intelligence, is a truly revolutionary feature of computer science, set to become a core component of all modern software over the coming years and decades.
Intelligence which at times is associated with National Security is the job to analyze data, connect disparate data sets, apply context to data, infer meaning from data, and ultimately make analytic judgments based on all available data. This then gives the need to adopt Artificial Intelligence, because of the potential it possesses in executing high volumes of data with a significant amount of speed and efficiency. This discussion wants to explore the relationship of augmenting Intelligence using machines and provide the right framework to accelerate mission capability development across the Intelligence Community. 

## The co-relation of AI and Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence deals with the development of systems which are able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence setting the stage for all the others, and offers a view of AI enterprise based around the idea of intelligent agents, thus systems that can decide what to do and do it. Systems which are problem solving oriented, concentrating on methods for deciding what to do when one needs to think ahead several steps, for example in navigating across country or playing chess. AI can also be set through combing knowledge and reasoning, discussing ways to represent knowledge about the world, how it works, what it is currently like, what one's actions might do and how to reason logically with that knowledge. Resultantly AI would act logically on how to use these reasoning methods to decide what to do, particularly by constructing plans. In cases of uncertain knowledge, the system would concentrate on reasoning and decision-making in the presence of uncertainty about the world, as might be faced, for example, by a system for medical diagnosis and treatment.
In 1947 when the notable Intelligence community was formed in the USA, data was held by the government and clients were the fighters and policy makers which made IC require special ways to take the data. With the advent of 9\11, individual became the enemy through exploitation of social media making information the biggest threat. Intelligence mission in this world is to know the truth, see beyond the horizon and allow leaders or decision makers to act before events play out. Human talents are important in harnessing, understanding of information and master technology so as to have intelligence dominance.

## The importance of AI in Intelligence

Andrew Hallman, deputy director for digital futures at CIA, told FedScoop in June that, “AI will give speed advantage in data intake and pattern recognition and enable a high-order human cognition.”  The closing of gap between decisions and data collection is a top priority for the Intelligence Community. Leveraging artificial intelligence, automation, and augmentation technologies to amplify the effectiveness of intelligence workforce will advance mission capability and enhance the IC’s ability to provide needed data interpretation to decision makers. Let’s just imagine the importance of AI in intelligence analysis for top Intelligence officials world over who are responsible for giving everyday Presidential Daily Briefing.
In geospatial intelligence, AI accelerates the analysis of overhead imagery. In counterterrorism, AI extracts actionable intelligence from seized media. AI adoption in the armed forces is more than just hype. I believe these specific applications add substance to the broader conversation about AI in national security
## How AI is used in Intelligence
The augmentation of intelligence and machines initiative will enable the IC to fundamentally change the way it produces intelligence. Superiority will be achieved by adopting the best available commercial AI applications and combining them with IC’s unique algorithms and data holdings to augment the reasoning capabilities of our analysts. Simply stated by Sue Gordon former Director in CIA, “If it is knowable, and it is important, then we know it.”  
This is one of the most important aspects when one explores correlation of AI with intelligence as in the now and future of technological advancement because at the way large amounts of data is processed to come out with a definite outcome that is actionable with precision. AI uses tools and insights from many fields, including computer science, psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, operations research, economics, control theory, probability, optimization and logic. It also overlaps with tasks such as robotics, control systems, scheduling, data mining, logistics, speech recognition, facial recognition and many others.

## AI upside and downside

Cyber experts or professionals are looking at AI with both enthusiasm and trepidation. On the one hand, it has the potential to add entirely new layers of defense for critical data and infrastructure, but on the other, it can also be used as a powerful weapon to thwart those defenses without leaving a trace. The challenge for today’s cyber security experts is to keep one step ahead of the bad guys, which should begin with a clear understanding of exactly how AI can be used as an offensive data weapon.
Nations will try to identify, steal, and corrupt or otherwise counteract the AI and related assets of others, and will use AI against each other in pursuit of their own national interests
Calculating risks by thinking about threats, vulnerabilities, probabilities, and the impact or costs of bad outcomes is more challenging with AI because it is so different.
Instead of an analyst spending hours poring over a stream of satellite photos, looking for significant changes, the computer can complete the task in seconds.
Commercial industry that creates AI often lacks the expertise to integrate it into national security systems, which often require greater care and more rigorous testing than commercial systems.

## Recommendations

Strengthen the collaboration between the IC and industry, research agencies, and academic talent and grow the talent pool of AI technology expertise for the IC.
Solution is not to leave the analysts out, but to make them central to every aspect of developing and deploying AI and other technologies.
## Conclusion
The principles and conversations laid out here will allow the intelligence community to meet any challenges which shall be faced in this transformative era of AI revolution. The goal in all of this is to meet IC objectives now and into the future. The reality is, there is so far no AI technology on the horizon that can replace human judgment, and there has never been a greater need for the expertise of human analysts than today meaning to say, technology alone will not enhance national security.
